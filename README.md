## Our Solution (Architecture)

### 1. Minter

- You can create art from text and scribbles. Enter prompt and click on "Generate Art"
- Add NFT details such as name, description and click on "Mint NFT"
- This uploads the image to Arweave and creates an NFT using Mintbase SDK

### 2. NFT Marketplace

- This Marketplace is inspired from Mintbase Simple Marketplace Template and Official docs. It has been modified to suit AI NFT marketplace needs
- You can view all the NFTs minted by owners
- Click on an NFT to view its details and buy directly from the marketplace if it is listed for sale by owner.

### 3. Smart Contract

- `nftaiartistry.mintspace2.testnet` is the contract deployed on Near Testnet using Mintbase interface.
- It allows allowed minters to mint AI NFTs and list them for sale on the marketplace.
